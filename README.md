# Hello World! 👋 

Just another curious dev who breaks stuff to learn how they work 🔨
(Don't worry, I usually fix them... eventually 😅)

## 🌱 Currently
- Learning everything that catches my eye
- Building stuff that might or might not work
- Trying to understand why my Go routines are not routine 🤔
- Attempting to master Linux without breaking my system (too late!)

## ⚡ Fun fact
I collect new tech like some people collect Pokemon cards - gotta learn 'em all! 

```go
for {
    select {
    case <-learnNewTech:
        fmt.Println("Another technology? Why not!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Still processing the last 10 things I started learning...")
    }
}
```
